### <p align="center">Bunch of programs for ICO Bouty Hunters

Original idea was to create a service that can manage every aspect of every given ICO bounty.
### Key functions include: 
* notify about new bounties
* follow the requirements
* send updates
* submit weekly reports
* manage and promote participating accounts (twitter, facebook, telegram)
* Repost/retweet necessary updates
* Generate new posts/tweets
###### PS: Unfortunately, I cannot share the complete code as it was written for the commercial usage
