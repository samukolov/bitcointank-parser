### <p align="center">Bunch of programs for ICO Bouty Hunters

Original idea was to create a service that can manage every aspect of every given ICO bounty.
### Key functions include: 
* notify about new bounties
* follow the requirements
* send updates
* submit weekly reports
* manage and promote participating accounts (twitter, facebook, telegram)
* Repost/retweet necessary updates
* Generate new posts/tweets
###### PS: Unfortunately, I cannot share the complete code as it was written for the commercial usage

### Files that you can find above:

1. [parse_new_bounties.py](https://github.com/samukolov/bitcointank-parser/blob/master/parse_new_bounties.py) - searches for new bounty posts and notifies you about them via telegram

2. [add_bounty.py](https://github.com/samukolov/bitcointank-parser/blob/master/add_bounty.py) - GUI that may help you add new bounties to a database (in this case I was specifically asked to store everything in google spreadsheets)

3. [manage_twitter_accounts.py](https://github.com/samukolov/bitcointank-parser/blob/master/manage_twitter_accounts.py) - searches for new bounty posts and notifies you about them via telegram
